GIT REPOSITORY

Git is a program that tracks changes made to files. Once installed, Git can be initialised on a project to create a Git repository via the bash command
"git init", creating a folder labelled ".git/". This repository tracks all changes made to files in the project so as to build a complete history. If the
".git/" is deleted, all of the project history is also deleted.
Each change in a Git project is persisted to the repository. It is by this persistance that any previous version of a Git project can be retrieved.
The data stored in the ".git/" folder is put into a file. To retrieve this data, Git maps the all content (including commits) to a psuedo-unique key
generated via the SHA1 hashing algorithm, which produces a 20-digit long hexademial number for content that it is fed. It is by these keys that Git is
able to track the content in a Git project. The data inside the file is a compressed version of itself, referred to as a blob, which can be retrieved in
full with the bash command "git cat-file -p" followed by the SHA1 of the desired object in the root of the project.
