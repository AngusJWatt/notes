MODULES

A JavaScript module is essentially a JavaScript file that contains some code. In order to access the methods and attributes of the desired module, which
would otherwise be outside of the scope of other modules, the node method "require" and the attribute "module.exports" are required.
	/*>counter.js*/
	const counter = function(arr) {
		return `There are ${arr.length} elements in the array [${arr}].`;
	}
	module.exports = counter;
	/*>app.js*/
	const newCounter = require(`./counter`);
	console.log(counter([0,1,2]));
	/*There are 3 elements in the array [0,1,2].*/
